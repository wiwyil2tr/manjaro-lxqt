# manjaro-lxqt
manjaro lxqt iso

Manjaro-lxqt was once an excellent spin of Manjaro, but it has also been discontinued. I hereby announce the relaunch of the Manjaro-lxqt project, and I hope that friends who previously supported Manjaro-deepin can also give your support to Manjaro-lxqt. 
## Extracting

The isos bigger than certain threshold are provided in multipart zip files because of the filesize restriction of github. To extract the iso, download all the zipped parts, and open the zip file with ``file-roller``, ``engrampa`` or ``7z``.

or run

```
cat manjaro-deepin-24.0.1-241005-linux61.iso.z** > manjaro-deepin.zip
unzip manjaro-deepin.zip

```

This should automatically extract the iso from all the files.
